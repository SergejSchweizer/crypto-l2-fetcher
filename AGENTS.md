# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This repository should remain production-grade, maintainable, and reproducible.

All coding agents must optimize for:

- maintainability
- modularity
- reproducibility
- testability
- documentation quality
- scientific/technical rigor (when applicable)
- future extensibility

The codebase must be understandable by another engineer without tribal knowledge.

# Core Engineering Rules

## Architecture

Agents must preserve clear modular separation and explicit interfaces.

Current top-level structure:

```text
project/
|-- api/
|   |-- cli.py
|   `-- runtime.py
|-- ingestion/
|   |-- exchanges/
|   |   `-- deribit_l2.py
|   |-- http_client.py
|   |-- l2.py
|   `-- lake.py
|-- tests/
|-- README.md
|-- AGENTS.md
|-- pyproject.toml
`-- main.py
```

Rules:

- Keep modules isolated and cohesive.
- Avoid monolithic scripts for core logic.
- Prefer composable designs and separation of concerns.
- Prioritize long-term maintainability over short-term convenience.
- Do not reintroduce non-L2 features unless explicitly requested.

## Scalability And Reliability Policy

All technical decisions must account for likely growth, such as:

- more data/entities/users/traffic
- larger history/backfills
- higher job frequency
- additional integrations/providers

Required implications:

- Prefer incremental/delta processing over full rescans when feasible.
- Keep operations idempotent.
- Use bounded, configurable concurrency.
- Keep schema changes backward compatible and versioned.
- Preserve observability (progress, throughput, error isolation).
- Use storage/index strategies that remain efficient as volume grows.

---

# Code Quality Rules

## Type Safety

- Use type hints consistently.
- Functions should have explicit return types.

## Documentation

- Non-trivial functions/modules require docstrings.
- Public interfaces should include concise usage guidance.

## Formatting And Static Checks

Code must remain compatible with project quality gates, typically:

- `ruff` (or equivalent linter/formatter)
- `mypy`/`pyright` (or equivalent type checker)
- `pytest` (or equivalent test runner)

---

# Testing Rules

After meaningful code changes, run relevant checks and tests.

Minimum expectation:

- run targeted tests for changed areas
- run full test suite before finalization when practical

If checks cannot be run, explicitly state what was not run and why.

---

# Git Hygiene Rules

The repository must not track local-only or cache artifacts.

Always ignore and keep untracked (unless repo intentionally requires otherwise):

- `.venv/`
- `.vscode/`
- `__pycache__/`
- `.pytest_cache/`
- `.mypy_cache/`
- `.ruff_cache/`
- `.cache/`
- `.ipynb_checkpoints/`
- `.env`
- `.env.*` (except explicit examples such as `.env.example`)

If local-only files are accidentally tracked, remove them from git index while keeping local copies.

## Commit Message Rules

Use Conventional Commits:

```text
type(scope): short summary
```

Allowed `type` values:

- `feat`
- `fix`
- `refactor`
- `test`
- `docs`
- `chore`
- `ci`
- `build`
- `perf`

Rules:

- Use imperative mood.
- Keep summary concise.
- Prefer a meaningful scope.

---

# Security Rules

- Never commit secrets or credentials.
- Use environment variables and local config files.
- Keep sensitive config out of version control.
- Provide `.env.example` (or equivalent) for required variables.
- Do not place live secret values in docs.

---

# Documentation Rules

## README.md

`README.md` should function as a technical entry point and operations guide.

It should cover:

- project overview
- architecture summary
- setup/install
- current `loader-l2-m1` usage/workflow
- testing and quality checks
- runtime configuration notes
- known limitations
- future improvements

## Removed Research Artifacts

This repository is currently an L2 ingestion utility, not a research-report repository. Do not recreate `REPORT.md`, notebooks, generated figures, sample plots, modeling modules, or evaluation modules unless the user explicitly asks to expand the project scope.

## Documentation-Code Consistency (MANDATORY)

- Upon essential code changes, compare `README.md` against current code behavior.
- Fix all inconsistencies in the same change set.

---

# Reproducibility Rules

- Keep configs and execution paths deterministic where feasible.
- Version important artifacts and schemas.
- Preserve seeds and experiment/runtime config for reproducible runs.

---

# Pull Request / Change Rules

For meaningful changes, agents should:

- keep scope focused
- add or update tests
- update relevant docs
- note architectural implications

---

# Failure Conditions

Agents must not:

- leave undocumented critical behavior changes
- skip validation without disclosure
- introduce unverifiable claims in documentation/reports
- leave stale docs after essential code changes

---

# End Goal

The repository should remain:

- production-grade for engineers
- reproducible for operators/researchers
- understandable for reviewers
- extensible for future contributors and agents
